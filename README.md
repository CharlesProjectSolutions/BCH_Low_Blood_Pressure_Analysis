# 📌 Project Overview
During pediatric surgeries, **low blood pressure** can pose serious risks. This project analyzes blood pressure data to identifies cases where **systolic blood pressure dropped below a safe threshold** for at least **14 consecutive minutes**, helping Boston Children's Hospistal **(BCH)** assess risks and quickly spot potentially dangerous trends in real-time.

## ⚠️ Problem Statement
Blood pressure monitoring during surgeries is crucial, but **prolonged low BP incidents often go unnoticed** in large datasets.  Without clear tracking, medical teams may miss critical cases, which can lead to potential health risks for children undergoing pediatric surgery. 

## 🎯 Objective
- Identify patients whose **blood pressure dropped dangerously low for 14+ minutes**.
- Provide **insights through visualizations** to help doctors analyze trends.
- Generate a **report listing affected patients and duration of low BP events**.
